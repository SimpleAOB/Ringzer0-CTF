This is a bruteforce approach that doesn't use an external source for the hashes

1. Start by generating the hashes using `_hashgen.py`
2. Wait for it to finish, it'll take a while
3. Run the C# application, depending on the hash given by Ringzer0, might have to do it two or three times.
4. Copy the flag given by the application and done.
